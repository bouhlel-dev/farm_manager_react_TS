# ðŸŽ¯Farm Field Management App

## Introduction
The **Farm Field Management App** is a simple web-based tool designed to help farmers manage their fields efficiently. It allows users to create fields sectioned like a chessboard, add trees to each section, and maintain a history of each tree's growth and maintenance.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Create a New Field**: Define field dimensions by specifying the number of trees horizontally and vertically.
- **Chessboard-style Grid**: Visual representation of the field with interactive sections.
- **Add Trees**: Select a section, specify the tree type, and save it.
- **Manage Tree History**: Maintain logs for planting date, growth status, pruning, and harvest details.


## Usage
1. Navigate to the homepage.
2. Enter field dimensions to generate the grid.
3. Click on a section to add a tree and specify its type.
4. View and update tree history records.

## Future Enhancements
- User authentication for personalized field management.
- Data export options (CSV, PDF).
- Visual indicators for tree health and growth stages.
